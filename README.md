# What is Numpy

NumPy is an extension to the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

NumPy targets the CPython reference implementation of Python, which is a non-optimizing bytecode compiler/interpreter. Mathematical algorithms written for this version of Python often run much slower than compiled equivalents. NumPy seeks to address this problem by providing multidimensional arrays and functions and operators that operate efficiently on arrays. Thus any algorithm that can be expressed primarily as operations on arrays and matrices can run almost as quickly as the equivalent C code.

# What is SciPy

SciPy is a computing environment and open source ecosystem of software for the Python programming language used by scientists, analysts and engineers doing scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy also refers to a specific open source library / Python package of algorithms and mathematical tools that form a core element of the SciPy environment for technical computing. The SciPy environment includes the NumPy and SciPy libraries, along with an expanding set of additional scientific computing libraries like IPython, Matplotlib, pandas and SymPy. It has similar users to other applications such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, and Scilab.

SciPy contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.
